## Solver options
The user may wish to modify some additional solver parameters.

When using the penalty method to account for general constraints,
the most important parameters which determine the speed of 
convergence are the **initial value** of the penalty weight and the 
**update factor**. These are set using

```python
solver_config.with_penalty_weight_update_factor(8.0)       \
             .with_initial_penalty(20.0)
``` 

The number of the initial penalty weights must be equal to 
$n_c$; the number of constraints. If you need to set all 
weights to the same value, use

```python
solver_config.with_initial_penalty(100.0)
```

In embedded applications it is often important that the solver
is forced to terminate within a given time period. The user may
set the **maximum runtime** (in microseconds) using

```python
# Maximum duration: 50ms
solver_config.with_max_duration_micros(50000)
```

Lastly, the maximum number of outer iterations can be set using

```python
solver_config.with_max_outer_iterations(num_out_iters)
```

The number of outer iterations should be kept reasonably small
to avoid too high values of the penalty parameters (which increase
exponentially).

A complete list of solver options is given in the following table

| Method                                 | Explanation                                 |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|

| `with_delta_tolerance`                 | Tolerance $\delta$                          |
| `with_initial_penalty`                 | Initial penalty value, $c_0$                |
| `with_max_inner_iterations`            | Maximum number of outer iterations          |
| `with_max_outer_iterations`            | Maximum number of inner iterations          |
| `with_penalty_weight_update_factor`    | Update factor of penalty weight, $\rho$     |
| `with_initial_tolerance`               | Initial tolerance, $\epsilon_0$             |
| `with_sufficient_decrease_coefficient` | Sufficient decrease coeff. (for skipping penalty update) |
| `with_max_duration_micros`             | Maximum duration of execution in micros     |
| `with_cbfgs_parameters`                | CBFGS parameters                            |
| `with_lbfgs_memory`                    | LBFGS memory                                | 
| `with_inner_tolerance_update_factor`   | Update factor for the inner tolerance       | 

## Build options

During the design phase, one needs to experiment with the problem
formulation and solver parameters. This is way the default build
mode is the "debug" mode, which compiles fast, but it suboptimal.
Building in "release" mode takes slightly longer to compile, but
can lead to a significant speed-up. To do so, use the option

```python
build_config.with_build_mode(
    og.config.BuildConfiguration.DEBUG_MODE)
```

Î¿r 

```python
build_config.with_build_mode(
    og.config.BuildConfiguration.RELEASE_MODE)
```

You can either compile for your own system, or cross-compile for a 
different target system. For example, to cross-compile for a Raspberry Pi,
set the following option

```python
build_config.with_target_system("arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf")
```

or 

```python
build_config.with_target_system("rpi")  # Raspberry Pi
```

Note that you need to install the necessary target first.


| Method                        | Explanation                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `with_build_directory`        | Target build directory; the default is `.`  |
| `with_build_mode`             | `release` or `debug`; the default option is `release`, which requires more time to compile, but leads to high performance executables; use `debug` for faster compilation, at the cost of lower performance (this is useful when experimenting with OpEn)  |
| `with_tcp_interface_config`   | Enable TCP server; provide configuration    |
| `with_target_system`          | Target system                               |
| `with_build_c_bindings`       | Enalbe generation of C/C++ bindings         |
| `with_rebuild`                | Whether to do a clean build                 |
| `with_open_version`           | Use a certain version of OpEn (see [all versions]), e.g., `with_open_version("0.6.0")`, or a local version of OpEn (this is useful when you want to download the latest version of OpEn from github). You can do so using `with_open_version(local_path="/path/to/open/")`. |

## TCP/IP interface 

### Generation of TCP server

In order to change the IP and port at which the server listens
for requests (e.g., for remote connections), you may crate an 
`TcpServerConfiguration` object as follows

```python
tcp_config = og.config.TcpServerConfiguration('10.8.0.12', 9555)
```
                               
and then provide it to the builder configuration using 

```python
builder_config.with_tcp_interface_config(tcp_config)
```

### Communicate with TCP server

There are two ways to connect to a generated TCP server and call the
auto-generated optimizer:

<div class="alert alert-info">
<b>Connect to a local optimizer</b> by providing the path of the optimizer
directory. For that purpose, we need to create an instance of 
<code>OptimizerTcpManager</code> and specify the path to the auto-generated optimizer.
</div>

For example,

```python
mng = og.tcp.OptimizerTcpManager('python_build/the_optimizer')
```

we can then `start` the optimizer. The TCP manager known what IP and port 
to link to, so we can `call` it directly.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<b>Connect to a local optimizer</b> and <b>customize</b> its IP and port. 
This is particularly useful if you need to start multiple instances of a TCP 
server (with different ports).
</div>

For example,

```python
ip = '0.0.0.0'
port = 5678
mng = og.tcp.OptimizerTcpManager('python_build/the_optimizer', ip, port)
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
<b>Connect to a remote optimizer</b> by providing its IP and port. In that 
case we assume that an optimizer is up an running at some remote address
and listens for connections at a certain port. In that case, we cannot 
<code>start</code> the optimizer remotely using the TCP manager. 
</div>



For example to connect to a *remote* TCP server at `10.8.0.7:5678`, we can
create a TCP manager as follows:

```python
mng = og.tcp.OptimizerTcpManager(ip="10.8.0.7", port=5678)
```

A list of the methods of `OptimizerTcpManager` is given below:

| Method          | Explanation                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `start`         | Starts the (local) server; throws an exception if the IP is not local. If the server is local, it will start in a separate thread and will remain alive unit `kill` is invoked. |
| `ping`          | Pings the server to check if it is alive    |
| `call`          | Calls the TCP server; provides a parameter and the solver responds with either the solution or an error report |
| `kill`                | Kills the server associated with the TCP manager; works both on local and remote servers. |


## Metadata

The solver metadata offer important information about the auto-generated 
solver such as its name


| Method                        | Explanation                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `with_optimizer_name`         | Optimizer name  (which is also the name of the folder in which the auto-generated solver will be stored). The default optimizer name is `open_optimizer` |
| `with_authors`                | Provide list of author names                |
| `with_licence`                | Name or URL of license of generated solver; the default licence is the MIT licence  |
| `with_version`                | Version of auto-generated solver; the default version is `0.0.0` |
