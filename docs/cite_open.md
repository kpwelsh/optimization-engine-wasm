Please, cite OpEn as follows:
```bibtex
@inproceedings{open2020,
  author = "P. Sopasakis and E. Fresk and P. Patrinos",
  title = "{OpEn}: Code Generation for Embedded Nonconvex Optimization",
  booktitle = "IFAC World Congress",
  year = "2020",
  address = "Berlin, Germany"
}
```

Cite the original PANOC paper as follows:
```bibtex
@inproceedings{panoc2017,
  author    = {Stella, L. and Themelis, A. 
               and Sopasakis, P. and Patrinos, P.},
  title     = {A simple and efficient algorithm for
               nonlinear model predictive control},
  booktitle = {IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)},
  year      = {2017},

  pages     = {1939-1944},
  doi       = {10.1109/CDC.2017.8263933}
}
```

You may also cite the following papers where we use PANOC in lab experiments - first, for obstacle avoidance on an autonomous ground vehicle carrying a trailer:

```bibtex
