You may now auto-generate an **Optimization Engine** module, which solves parametric optimization problems (such as model predictive control problems) and can be consumed over **UDP sockets**! Read more [here](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/docs/matlab-interface). This way, the parametric optimizer can be easily called from any programming language. More importantly, the code generation can be carried out in one line of code, while, if necessary, it can be fully configured.
